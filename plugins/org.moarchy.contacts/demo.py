"""A book with people in it, where the app reads it.

An address book with nothing in it photographs as an empty screen, and every
part of this app -- the initial a name is filed under, the two lines under it,
the detail sheet -- is only itself once somebody is in the list. Contacts has
no GTK half to borrow a fixture from, which is why this one writes the JSON by
hand rather than running an app's own writer.

    MOARCHY_CONTACTS_DIR=/tmp/c plugins/org.moarchy.contacts/demo.py

The names are invented, and so is every number: the exchange prefixes are the
ones reserved for drama (555 in North America, 7700 900xxx in the UK, and
Germany's own 0152 range used with a number nobody was issued), so nothing here
can ring a person who exists. The schema and the one-space indent are Store.js's
`serialize()`, so the app reads this file without a special case and rewrites
it in the same shape.
