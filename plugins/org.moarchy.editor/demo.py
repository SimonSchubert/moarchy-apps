"""Files to open, and the list that remembers them, where the app reads both.

An editor with nothing in it photographs as a plus on an empty screen, and the
parts of this app worth looking at -- a row that says which folder and when, a
file in monospace with its lines wrapped, the box that says why a file is read
only -- are only themselves once there are files. So this writes five, under a
home/ of its own inside the data directory, and the state.json that lists them.

    MOARCHY_EDITOR_DIR=/tmp/e plugins/org.moarchy.editor/demo.py

The screenshots point MOARCHY_EDITOR_HOME at that home/, so a row reads
~/Documents rather than the scratch directory's full path. Nothing here is
written anywhere but the directory it is given.

The fourth file has a no-break space in it, pasted the way one arrives from a
web page. It is the fixture for the read-only box, and it is a real case: a
menu copied off a restaurant's site is exactly how one reaches a phone.

MOARCHY_EDITOR_EMPTY=1 writes nothing, for the first-run screen.
