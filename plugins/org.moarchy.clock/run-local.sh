# The plugin imports its chrome as `ui`, which the installers vendor from
# shared/qs_ui. Nothing vendors it in a checkout, so this does that first and
# then hands shell.qml to quickshell. No omarchy-shell involved: this is the
# same path a package on another distribution would take.
#
# Standalone, the alarm only watches the clock while the window is open --
# there is nothing here to keep the plugin loaded. On the phone the shell does,
# which is the whole argument for this app being a plugin.
#
#   MOARCHY_CLOCK_PAGE=stopwatch   opens on that tab
#   MOARCHY_CLOCK_NOW=1789475376   pins the clock, as the shot harness does
#   MOARCHY_CLOCK_OFFLINE=1        rings without making a sound
