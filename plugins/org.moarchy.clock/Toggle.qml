// The switch on an alarm.
//
// Not the kit's Check, which is a tick box, and the difference is not
// decoration: a tick box says *this one is selected* and a switch says *this
// one is on*. An alarm is the second, and it is the one control on the screen
// somebody uses without reading anything, so it has to be the shape their
// thumb already knows.
//
// One control in one app, which is why it lives here rather than in
// shared/qs_ui. If a second plugin needs a switch it should move, and that is
// what the kit's README means by "the half that is genuinely the same".
