// A clock for a phone: the time, an alarm, a stopwatch and a timer.
//
// Three tabs and no fourth. Android's clock has a world-clock page and this
// does not, because the one thing a world clock needs is a list of somewhere
// else -- and the page that would carry it is the page a phone already has a
// clock on, in its own status bar. What is left is the three things a phone is
// actually picked up to do with time, and the first screen of the three is a
// dial, because an app called Clock whose first screen is a list is an app
// that has hidden the thing it is named after.
//
// It was written for the shell first, and for this app that is not a
// convenience -- it is the only arrangement in which an alarm works at all.
// `keepLoaded` means this Item exists from the moment the shell starts, so the
// timer that watches for an alarm is running while the window is nowhere on
// screen. A GTK app in `apps/` could not do this without a second package
// holding a systemd service, and then the alarm would live somewhere the app
// could not see.
//
// What it still cannot do is wake a phone that is asleep. Nothing a user
// process can do will: `WakeSystem=true` on a systemd timer is root's, and so
// is `rtcwake`. So the honest behaviour is the one implemented here -- an
// alarm that came due while the phone was off rings when it comes back, and
// says how late it is, up to an hour. Past that it is recorded as missed and
// said out loud, because a phone that rings at ten for a seven o'clock alarm
// is worse than one that admits it slept through.
//
// Bound because every list on these three screens is a Repeater or a ListView
// whose delegate reads the palette, the clock and the units off `root`.
