"""Where the phone is, three more places, and a week of weather for each.

The plugins in this repository that talk to a network have the same problem
when somebody wants to look at them: the screen is only interesting once an
answer has arrived, and an answer that arrives is different every time it does.
The GTK apps solve it with a `demo.py` that writes their store by hand, and the
screenshot harness runs it before it photographs anything. This is that file
for a plugin rather than an app -- same idea, same place on the disk.

    MOARCHY_WEATHER_DIR=/tmp/w plugins/org.moarchy.weather/demo.py
    MOARCHY_WEATHER_DIR=/tmp/w MOARCHY_WEATHER_OFFLINE=1 \\
        plugins/org.moarchy.weather/run-local.sh

Nothing here is random and nothing is fetched. The temperatures are a cosine
with its peak at three in the afternoon, the codes are a fixed list per place,
and the times are anchored to the hour this runs in -- because a fixture dated
last Tuesday draws an empty screen, the app having correctly dropped every hour
of it as past.
