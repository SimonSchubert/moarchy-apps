// Launches as its own Quickshell process, for a system without omarchy-shell.

//   quickshell -p plugins/org.moarchy.launches/shell.qml
//
// Inside the shell this file is never read: the plugin host instantiates
// Launches.qml itself, keeps it loaded, and decides when the window is up.
// Here nothing does, so the window opens at startup and closing it ends the
// process -- a window that is gone with a process still running is how an app
// becomes a battery bug.
//
// Everything else is the same file the phone runs. The shell-only parts of
// Launches.qml are already written to be absent: `shell` stays null, so the
// summon/hide calls it guards are skipped, and the theme FileView on
// colors.toml simply never loads, which leaves the fallback palette.
