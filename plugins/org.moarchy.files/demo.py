"""A home directory to photograph, instead of whoever is running the harness.

Every other demo.py here writes the one JSON file its app reads. This app's
data *is* the filesystem, so the fixture is a small tree of real directories
and real files -- sparse ones, so a 1.4 GB video costs nothing to make and
still reports 1.4 GB to `find`.

Where it goes is `$MOARCHY_FILES_HOME`, which is the same variable the app
reads to decide what "home" is, so nothing here has to agree with the app
about a path. `$MOARCHY_FILES_NOW` is the clock both halves are pinned to:
the app reads its "Yesterday" and "Tue" against it, and the mtimes below are
set from it, so a picture taken on one day and a picture taken on another are
of the same directory.

It refuses to write anywhere it did not make, because the whole point of this
app is that it can delete things and the whole point of this file is that it
is run by a harness with a scratch directory it has just made.
