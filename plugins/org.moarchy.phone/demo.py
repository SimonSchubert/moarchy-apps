"""A call log with a week in it, and the address book it names people from.

Recents with nothing in it photographs as an empty box, and the parts of the
screen that are the point -- a missed call in red, a name where a number was,
"Yesterday" -- only exist once there are calls. So this writes calls.json in
Store.js's shape, and a contacts.json beside it in the place Contacts keeps
one, because Phone reads names from there and nowhere else.

    MOARCHY_PHONE_DIR=/tmp/p/moarchy-phone plugins/org.moarchy.phone/demo.py

Every number is one nobody was issued: 555 in North America, 7700 900xxx in
the UK, and Germany's 0152 range with a subscriber number made up.
